These files are taken from udunits, version 2.2.28.

The source files have been slightly modified in order to fit them into this
build system. The changes that were made are:

 - converter.h and udunits2.h include harp_udunits2_mangle.h to name mangle
   all public symbols.

 - scanner.l and parser.y have been renamed to utscanner.l and utparser.y

 - added options '%option prefix="harp_ut"', '%option noinput', and
   '%option nounput' to utscanner.l

 - scanner.c is no longer included by parser.y resulting in the following
   additional changes:
   - _restartScanner is now a global variable named utrestartScanner
   - _isTime is now a non-static function named utisTime
   - #define yyparse utparse
   - #define yylex harp_utlex
   - #define yyerror harp_uterror
   - added ut_get_bufferpos function (returning yy_c_buf_p  - buf->yy_ch_buf)
   - added several function declarations to prevent compiler warnings

 - Made the following functions static: gregorianDateToJulianDay,
   julianDayToGregorianDate
