Python interface
================

The Python interface consists of a Python package ``'harp'`` that provides a set
of functions to :py:func:`import <harp.import_product>` and :py:func:`export
<harp.export_product>` HARP products. The import can be used to read products
using the HARP format or to read non-HARP products of a type :doc:`supported by
HARP <ingestions/index>`. The Python interface depends on the ``_cffi_backend``
module, which is part of the C foreign function interface (cffi) package. This
package must be installed in order to be able to use the Python interface. See
the `cffi documentation`_ for details on how to install the cffi package.

Products are represented in Python by instances of :py:class:`harp.Product`,
which can be manipulated freely from within Python. A :py:class:`harp.Product`
instance contains a :py:class:`harp.Variable` instance for each variable
contained in the product. A :py:class:`harp.Product` also contains special
entries for the global attributes `source_product` and `history`
(a :py:class:`harp.Product` will thus not be able to contain variables with
these names). Note that the `Conventions`, `datetime_start` and `datetime_stop`
global attributes are not included in a :py:class:`harp.Product` as these are
automatically handled by the import/export functions of HARP.

Products can be :py:func:`exported <harp.export_product>` as HARP compliant
products in any of the file formats supported by the HARP C library
(NetCDF/HDF4/HDF5). Such exported products can subsequently be processed further
using the :doc:`HARP command line tools <tools>`. Products can also be
:py:func:`converted <harp.to_dict>` to an ``OrderedDict``. This can be
convenient when there is a need to interface with existing code such as plotting
libraries, or when the additional information provided by the
:py:class:`harp.Product` representation is not needed.

Dimension types
---------------

The HARP C library defines several dimension types. Each dimension of a variable
is associated with one of these dimension types. The number of dimension types
should match the number of dimensions of the data array.

In Python, all dimension types are referred to by name, except the
``independent`` dimension type. Dimension type names are case-sensitive. The
``independent`` dimension type is special because variable dimensions associated
with this dimension type need not be of the same length (in contrast to all
other dimension types). The ``independent`` dimension type is represented in
Python by ``None``.

Each :py:class:`harp.Variable` instance contains an attribute ``dimension``,
which is a list of dimension types. For each dimension of a variable, the
``dimension`` attribute indicates the dimension type it is associated with.

The dimension types supported by HARP are:

time
    Temporal dimension; this is the only appendable dimension.

vertical
    Vertical dimension, indicating height or depth.

spectral
    Spectral dimension, associated with wavelength, wavenumber, or frequency.

latitude
    Latitude dimension, only to be used for the latitude axis of a regular
    (latitude, longitude) grid.

longitude
    Longitude dimension, only to be used for the longitude axis of a regular
    (latitude, longitude) grid.

independent
    Independent dimension, used to index other quantities, such as the corner
    coordinates of ground pixel polygons.

Data types
----------

The HARP Python interface takes care of the conversion of product and variables
from the C domain to the Python domain and back. This section describes the
relation between types in the C domain and types in the Python domain.

The table below shows the type map that is used to convert the high level
concepts product and variable.

+---------------+------------------+
| C type        | Python type      |
+===============+==================+
| harp_product  | harp.Product     |
+---------------+------------------+
| harp_variable | harp.Variable    |
+---------------+------------------+

The table below shows the type map that is used when importing a product, i.e.
when translating from the C domain to the Python domain.

Variable data arrays are converted to NumPy arrays. The NumPy data type used for
the converted array is determined from the HARP data type of the variable
according to the type map shown below. Zero-dimensional arrays of length 1 are
converted to Python scalars using the ``numpy.asscalar()`` function. The
resulting Python type is also shown in the type map.

Product and variable attributes, being scalars, are converted directly to Python
scalars. The Python type is determined from the HARP data type according to the
type map.

Zero-terminated C strings are always converted to instances of type ``str`` in
Python. See section :ref:`Unicode <unicode-details>` for details on unicode
decoding in Python 3.

+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+
| HARP data type   | NumPy dtype    | Python type | unicode decoding |
+==================+================+=============+==================+
| harp_type_int8   | numpy.int8     | int         |                  |
+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+
| harp_type_int16  | numpy.int16    | int         |                  |
+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+
| harp_type_int32  | numpy.int32    | int         |                  |
+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+
| harp_type_float  | numpy.float32  | float       |                  |
+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+
| harp_type_double | numpy.float64  | float       |                  |
+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+
| harp_type_string | numpy.object\_ | str         | Python 3         |
+------------------+----------------+-------------+------------------+

The table below shows the type map that is used when exporting a product, i.e.
when translating from the Python domain to the C domain.

NumPy object arrays (that is, NumPy arrays with data type ``numpy.object_``)
will be converted to arrays of zero-terminated C strings. The elements of a
NumPy object array must be all ``str`` or all ``bytes``. (Note that on Python 2,
``bytes`` is an alias of ``str``.) NumPy arrays with data type ``numpy.str_`` or
``numpy.bytes_`` will be converted to arrays of zero-terminated C strings as
well.

NumPy scalars with data type ``numpy.object_``, ``numpy.str_``, or
``numpy.bytes_`` are converted following the same rules as for NumPy arrays.
NumPy scalars are treated as NumPy arrays of length 1 in this respect. Python
scalars of type ``str`` or ``bytes`` will also be converted to zero-terminated C
strings.

Unicode encoding is only performed for array elements or scalars of type ``str``
or ``numpy.str_``, and only on Python 3. See section :ref:`Unicode
<unicode\-details>` for details on unicode encoding in Python 3.

Any NumPy array, NumPy scalar, or Python scalar that cannot be converted
according to the rules described above is assumed to be numeric. An attempt will
be made to determine the minimal HARP data type that it, or its elements, can be
safely cast to (according to the function ``numpy.can_cast()`` using the
``'safe'`` casting option). See the type map for details.

Unicode
-------

Zero-terminated C strings received from the HARP C library are always converted
to instances of type ``str`` in Python. Type ``str`` is a byte string in Python
2, but a unicode string in Python 3.

In Python 2, no unicode encoding or decoding is performed by the HARP Python
interface.

In Python 3, byte strings received from the HARP C library are decoded using a
configurable encoding. Unicode strings (instances of type ``str``) are encoded
using the same encoding into byte strings, which are sent to the HARP C library.
Byte strings (instances of type ``bytes``) are passed through without encoding.

The encoding used can be configured by the user, see the
:py:func:`harp.set_encoding` and :py:func:`harp.get_encoding` methods. The
default encoding is ``'ascii'``.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

   import harp
   import numpy

   # Create a product in Python and export it as a NetCDF file.
   product = harp.Product()
   harp.export_product(product, "empty.nc")

   # Add some variables to the product.
   product.foo = harp.Variable("foo")
   product.strings = harp.Variable(numpy.array(("foo", "bar", "baz")), ["time"])
   product.temperature = harp.Variable(numpy.ones((3, 5), dtype=numpy.float32),
                                       ["time", None])
   product.temperature.unit = "K"
   product.temperature.description = "temperature"

   # Pretty print information about the product.
   print(product)

   # Pretty print information about the variable 'temperature'.
   print(product.temperature)

   # Set valid minimum value of the variable 'temperature'. Note the use of item
   # access syntax instead of attribute access syntax.
   product["temperature"].valid_min = 0.0
   print(product.temperature)

   # Export the updated product as an HDF4 file.
   harp.export_product(product, "non-empty.hdf", file_format="hdf4")

   # Convert the product to an OrderedDict.
   dict_product = harp.to_dict(product)

   # Import an S5P L2 HCHO product.
   hcho_product = harp.import_product("S5P_NRTI_L2__HCHO___20080808T224727_20080808T234211_21635_01_021797_00000000T000000.nc",
                                      "solar_zenith_angle < 60 [degree]; latitude > 30 [degree_north]; latitude < 60 [degree_north]")

   # Pretty print information about the product.
   print(hcho_product)

   # Export the product as a HARP compliant data product.
   harp.export_product(hcho_product, "hcho.h5", file_format='hdf5', hdf5_compression=6)

API reference
-------------

This section describes the types, functions, and exceptions defined by the HARP
Python interface.

Types
^^^^^

This section describes the types defined by the HARP Python interface.

.. py:class:: harp.Product(source_product="", history="")

   Python representation of a HARP product.

   A product consists of product attributes and variables. Any attribute of a
   Product instance of which the name does not start with an underscore is
   either a variable or a product attribute. Product attribute names are
   reserved and cannot be used for variables.

   The list of names reserved for product attributes is:

   source_product
       Name of the original product this product is derived from.
   history
       New-line separated list of invocations of HARP command line tools that
       have been performed on the product.

   Variables can be accessed by name using either the attribute access ``'.'``
   syntax, or the item access ``'[]'`` syntax. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

      from __future__ import print_function

      # Alternative ways to access the variable 'HCHO_column_number_density'.
      density = product.HCHO_column_number_density
      density = product["HCHO_column_number_density"]

      # Iterate over all variables in the product. For imported  products, the
      # order of the variables is the same as the order in the source product.
      for name in product:
          print(product[name].unit)

   Product attributes can be accessed in the same way as variables, but are
   *not* included when iterating over the variables in a product. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

      from __future__ import print_function

      # Print product attributes.
      print(product.source_product)
      print(product.history)

   :param str source_product: Name of the original product this product is
                              derived from.
   :param str history: New-line separated list of invocations of HARP command
                       line tools that have been performed on the product.

.. py:class:: harp.Variable(data, dimension=[], unit=None, valid_min=None, \
                            valid_max=None, description=None, enum=None)

   Python representation of a HARP variable.

   A variable consists of data (either a scalar or NumPy array), a list of
   dimension types that describe the dimensions of the data, and a number of
   optional attributes: physical unit, minimum valid value, maximum valid value,
   human-readable description, and enumeration name list.

   :param data: Value(s) associated with the variable; can be either a scalar or
                a NumPy array.
   :param list dimension: List of strings indicating the dimensions the variable
                          depends on.
   :param str unit: Physical unit the values associated with the variable are
                    expressed in.
   :param valid_min: Minimum valid value; any value below this threshold is
                     considered to be invalid.
   :param valid_max: Maximum valid value; any value above this threshold is
                     considered to be invalid.
   :param str description: Humand-readble description of the variable.
   :param list enum: List of strings with the names of each enumeration value.

Functions
^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the functions defined by the HARP Python library.

.. py:function:: harp.import_product(filename, operations="", options="", \
                                     reduce_operations="", post_operations="")

   Import a product from a file.
 
   This will first try to import the file as an HDF4, HDF5, or netCDF file that
   complies to the HARP Data Format. If the file is not stored using the HARP
   format then it will try to import it using one of the available ingestion
   modules.

   If the filename argument is a list of filenames, a globbing (glob.glob())
   pattern, or a list of globbing patterns then the harp.import_product() function
   will be called on each individual matching file. All imported products will then
   be appended into a single merged product and that merged product will be returned.

   :param str,list filename: Filename, file pattern, or list of filenames/patterns
                       of the product(s) to import
   :param str operations: Actions to apply as part of the import; should be
                       specified as a semi-colon separated string of operations;
                       in case a list of products is ingested these operations will be
                       performed on each product individually before the data is merged.
   :param str options: Ingestion module specific options; should be specified as
                       a semi-colon separated string of key=value pairs; only
                       used if a file is not in HARP format.
   :param str reduce_operations: Actions to apply after each append; should be specified as a
                       semi-colon separated string of operations;
                       these operations will only be applied if the filename argument is
                       a file pattern or a list of filenames/patterns;
                       this advanced option allows for memory efficient application
                       of time reduction operations (such as bin()) that would
                       normally be provided as part of post_operations.
   :param str post_operations: Actions to apply after the list of products is merged;
                       should be specified as a semi-colon separated string of operations;
                       these operations will only be applied if the filename argument is
                       a file pattern or a list of filenames/patterns.
   :returns: Imported product.
   :rtype: harp.Product

.. py:function:: harp.import_product_metadata(filename, options="")

   Import specific metadata from a single file.

   This will try to extract the following information from a file.
    - datetime_start
    - datetime_stop
    - dimension lengths for time, latitude, longitude, vertical, and spectral
    - source_product

   If the file is not stored using the HARP format then it will try to import
   the metadata using one of the available ingestion modules.

   :param str filename: Filename of the product from which to extract the metadata
   :param str options: Ingestion module specific options; should be specified as
                       a semi-colon separated string of key=value pairs; only
                       used if a file is not in HARP format.
   :returns: Imported metadata.
   :rtype: collections.OrderedDict

.. py:function:: harp.export_product(product, filename, file_format="netcdf", \
                                     operations="", hdf5_compression=0)

   Export a HARP compliant product.

   :param str product: Product to export.
   :param str filename: Filename of the exported product.
   :param str operations: Actions to apply as part of the export; should be
                        specified as a semi-colon separated string of operations.
   :param str file_format: File format to use; one of 'netcdf', 'hdf4', or
                           'hdf5'.
   :param hdf5_compression: Compression level when exporting to hdf5
                            (0=disabled, 1=low, ..., 9=high).

.. py:function:: harp.concatenate(productlist)

   Combines all HARP products in the list into a single HARP output product.

   All non-time dependent variables from the input products are made time
   dependent before concatenating them.

   Trying to merge input products that do not have the same types of variables
   will result in an error.

   The 'index' variable will not be included in the concatenated product.

   The resulting product will not have a 'source_product' or 'history' global
   attribute set.

   :param list productlist: List of harp.Product objects.
   :returns: Single product containing concatenated content.
   :rtype: harp.Product

.. py:function:: harp.execute_operations(productlist, operations="", post_operations="")

   Apply operations on the given list of products. 'productlist' can be either
   a single 'harp.Product()' instance or a list of 'harp.Product()' instances.

   If a list of products is provided then the products will be concatenated/merged after
   the 'operations' on each product has been performed.

   If a 'post_operations' parameter is provided then these operations will be applied to
   the concatenated/merged product before it is returned.

   .. warning:: Note that this function will first export all products to the HARP
      C library and will import the final result back from the C library to the Python
      domain. This can have a considerable performance impact when products are large.
      You should therefore only use this function if the operation cannot be performed
      easily within the Python domain itself. Also, when using this function try to
      pass a 'harp.Product()' instance that contains the minimal set of variables that
      are needed to execute the operations.

   :param list productlist: List of harp.Product objects or single harp.Product object.
   :param str operations: Actions to apply on the product(s); should be
                       specified as a semi-colon separated string of operations;
                       in case a list of products is provided these operations will be
                       performed on each product individually before the data is merged.
   :param str post_operations: Actions to apply after the list of products is merged;
                       should be specified as a semi-colon separated string of operations;
                       these operations will only be applied if the productlist parameter
                       is a list of harp.Product objects.
   :returns: Single product containing concatenated content with operations being performed.
   :rtype: harp.Product

.. py:function:: harp.convert_unit(from_unit, to_unit, values)

   Perform unit conversion on the list of values.
   The list of values will be converted to an array of double values after which the
   HARP C library is used to convert the values from 'from_unit' to 'to_unit'.
   The function will return a copy of the values with converted units.

   :param str from_unit: Existing unit of the data that should be converted
                       (use udunits2 compliant units)
   :param str to_unit: Unit to which the data should be converted
                       (use udunits2 compliant units).
   :param values: an array with values on which unit conversion needs to be applied
   :returns: Numpy array of unit converted values

.. py:function:: harp.to_dict(product)

   Convert a :py:class:`harp.Product` instance to an ``OrderedDict``.

   The ``OrderedDict`` representation provides direct access to the data
   associated with each variable. All product attributes and all variable
   attributes except the unit attribute are discarded as part of the conversion.

   The unit attribute of a variable is represented by adding a scalar variable
   of type string with the name of the corresponding variable suffixed with
   ``'_unit'`` as name and the unit as value.

   The ``OrderedDict`` representation can be convenient when there is a need to
   interface with existing code such as plotting libraries, or when the
   additional information provided by the Product representation is not needed.

   Note that only :py:class:`harp.Product` instances can be exported as a HARP
   product. The ``OrderedDict`` representation does not contain enough
   information.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: python

      from __future__ import print_function

      # Convert input product to an OrderedDict.
      product = to_dict(input_product)

      # Accessing the variable 'HCHO_column_number_density'.
      product["HCHO_column_number_density"]

      # Accessing the unit attribute of the variable
      # 'HCHO_column_number_density'.
      product["HCHO_column_number_density_unit"]

      # Iterate over all variables in the product. For imported products, the
      # order of the variables is the same as the order in the source product.
      for name, value in product.items():
          print name, value

   :param harp.Product product: Product to convert.
   :returns: Converted product.
   :rtype: collections.OrderedDict

.. py:function:: harp.get_encoding()

   Return the encoding used to convert between unicode strings and C strings
   (only relevant when using Python 3).

   :returns: Encoding currently in use.
   :rtype: str

.. py:function:: harp.set_encoding(encoding)

   Set the encoding used to convert between unicode strings and C strings
   (only relevant when using Python 3).

   :param str encoding: Encoding to use.

.. py:function:: harp.version()

   Return the version of the HARP C library.

   :returns: HARP C library version.
   :rtype: str

Exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^

This sections describes the exceptions defined by the HARP Python interface.

.. py:exception:: harp.Error(*args)

   Exception base class for all HARP Python interface errors.

   :param tuple args: Tuple of arguments passed to the constructor; usually a
                      single string containing an error message.

.. py:exception:: harp.CLibraryError(errno=None, strerror=None)

   Exception raised when an error occurs inside the HARP C library.

   :param str errno: error code; if None, the error code will be retrieved from
                     the HARP C library.
   :param str strerror: error message; if None, the error message will be
                        retrieved from the HARP C library.

.. py:exception:: harp.UnsupportedTypeError(*args)

   Exception raised when unsupported types are encountered, either on the Python
   or on the C side of the interface.

   :param tuple args: Tuple of arguments passed to the constructor; usually a
                      single string containing an error message.

.. py:exception:: harp.UnsupportedDimensionError(*args)

   Exception raised when unsupported dimensions are encountered, either on the
   Python or on the C side of the interface.

   :param tuple args: Tuple of arguments passed to the constructor; usually a
                      single string containing an error message.

.. py:exception:: harp.NoDataError()

   Exception raised when the product returned from an import contains no
   variables, or variables without data.
